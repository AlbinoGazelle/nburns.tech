This is the public repo for my personal blog. Template is from StartBootStart but with some modifications.

# Usage

This repo is fairly specific to me and my needs, but if you'd like to use it:
* Clone the repo : `git clone https://github.com/AlbinoGazelle/nburns.tech.git`
* Delete all posts inside nburns.tech/posts except post_template.html and customize the template as you please.
* Specify the path to the cloned folder in your specific webserver as the root directory (`DocumentRoot` in Apache, `root` in nginx configuration files).
* Have fun!
