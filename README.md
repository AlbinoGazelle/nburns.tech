# Nathan's Tech Blog Source Code

Template code generated from [StartBootStart/Clean-Blog](https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-clean-blog)

# About

This is the public repo for my personal blog. Template is from StartBootStart but with some modifications.
This framework has 3 main pages. Home, About, and Directory.  

**Home** holds links and descriptions to the four most recent posts.  
**About** holds info about myself and who I am.  
**Directory** contains links to every post on the website.  

# Usage

This repo is fairly specific to me and my needs, but if you'd like to use it:
* Clone the repo : `git clone https://github.com/AlbinoGazelle/nburns.tech.git`
* Delete all posts inside nburns.tech/posts except post_template.html and customize the template as you please.
* Specify the path to the cloned folder in your specific webserver as the root directory (`DocumentRoot` in Apache, `root` in nginx configuration files).
* Have fun!


# Modifications

Created a directory to hold all posts.

Added a "to the top" button on all post pages.

Removed contact page.

Removed Facebook and Twitter links in footers. Added LinkedIn Link.

# Planned Modifications

Add a projects page to hold all current and past project links and information on each project.
